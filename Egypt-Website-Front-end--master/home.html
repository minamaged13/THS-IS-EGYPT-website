Inhabited by over 85 million, attracting up to 14.5 million visitors a year. What Egypt has to offer is more than just staring at the Great Pyramids of Giza, a cruise on the River Nile or a swim at the Red Sea, it’s a country that with its diversity can easily satisfy anyone’s taste bud; be it of those seeking adventure, wanting to go off the beaten path, those who like to party hard, those escaping the hustle and bustle of their daily life, those looking for exotic food and local encounters or those who wish to embark on an unforgettable journey.

Egypt, country located in the northeastern corner of Africa. Egypt’s heartland, the Nile River valley and delta, was the home of one of the principal civilizations of the ancient Middle East and, like Mesopotamia farther east, was the site of one of the world’s earliest urban and literate societies. Pharaonic Egypt thrived for some 3,000 years through a series of native dynasties that were interspersed with brief periods of foreign rule. After Alexander the Great conquered the region in 323 BC, urban Egypt became an integral part of the Hellenistic world. Under the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty, an advanced literate society thrived in the city of Alexandria, but what is now Egypt was conquered by the Romans in 30 BC. It remained part of the Roman Republic and Empire and then part of Rome’s successor state, the Byzantine Empire, until its conquest by Arab Muslim armies in AD 639–642.

in the 3rd century B.C.E. Each of the 33 dynasties included a series of rulers usually related by kinship or the location of their seat of power. Egyptian history is also divided into larger chunks, known as "kingdoms" and "periods," to distinguish times of strength and unity from those of change, foreign rule, or disunity.</p>
